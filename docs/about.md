# The text

The Dhammapada is divided in *vaggas* which are divided in *stanzas*.
There are 26 vaggas and 423 stanzas, which are numbered consecutively throughout the whole
work.

The book uses the latin script for the Pāli text.

As an example, here are the first 7 stanzas of the first vagga in Pāli:
